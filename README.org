* Quicksort in x86
  This project is a x86 implementation of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort][Quicksort]].

* Instructions
** The following code will convert quickSort.asm into executable quickSort.o
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
nasm -f elf32 quickSort.asm -o quickSort.o
#+END_SRC

** The following command line will use gcc to compile the object file into binary
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
gcc -m32 -fno-pic quickSort.o -o quickSort
#+END_SRC

** One can use the binary file like this(up to 1000 integers type parameter are allowed):
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./quickSort -98 55 66 -24 74 65 0 99
#+END_SRC

** Or you can use the auto_test.sh shell script to do all the things in one step:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./auto_test.sh
#+END_SRC

** for degugging
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
gdb quickSort
#+END_SRC

  Woolo implements the additional functions, which includes:
  1. Accepting numbers as arguments from command line.
  2. Being able to sort negative numbers as well.
